# Hi, I’m a student developer 👋

Learning Python, JavaScript, and basic web dev.  
This profile is where I drop small projects, experiments, and lessons learned.

- Currently building tiny apps instead of just watching tutorials.
- Tech: Python, JavaScript, HTML & CSS.
- Goal: turn ideas into real projects and get a bit less confused every day.

Thanks for stopping by!
